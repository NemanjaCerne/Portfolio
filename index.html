    <p>Hi there! My name is Nemanja, and I am an IT Trainee who is currently completing a Cert 3 Traineeship in
        Information Technology with <a href="https://www.tafensw.edu.au">TAFE NSW</a>. My passion for technology
        led me to pursue a career as a Full Stack Developer, and I am excited to share my journey with you.
        Before my current role, I worked at <a href="https://www.aldi.com.au/">ALDI Australia </a>where I gained valuable experience in customer service,
        sales, and team management. Prior to that, I was a manager at
        <a href="https://www.guzmanygomez.com.au/">Guzman Y Gomez</a>, where I developed strong leadership and problem-solving skills.
        Currently, I am working for <a href="https://www.dpie.nsw.gov.au">The Department of Planning</a>, where I am on rotation in the Spatial Data and
        Engineering team. Here, I am learning about policies, suppressions,
        data linking, and how to incorporate SQL and <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> into data. I am a fast learner who is able to work solo as
        well as in a team, and my curious and strong-willed nature has
        allowed me to excel in my current role.
        In addition to my work experience, I have competed at an international level in Karate for the <a href="https://www.karateaustralia.org.au/home/">Australian Karate
        Federation (AKF)</a>, where I was the rank 1 heavyweight
        male fighter for my span of competition. This has instilled in me a strong sense of discipline and dedication
        that I bring to everything I do.
        I am always eager to try new things and learn new skills, and I believe that my problem-solving mindset, coupled
        with my strong work ethic and ability to work well in
        a team, make me a great fit for a career in Full Stack Development.
        Thank you for taking the time to read my about me. I am looking forward to connecting with like-minded
        individuals who share my passion for technology and problem-solving.</p>
